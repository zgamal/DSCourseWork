/**
* This class controls the simulation. The design is entirely up to
* you. You should include a main method that takes the array of
* species file names passed in and populates a world with species of 
* each type.
* <p>
* Be sure to call WorldMap.pause every time
* through the main simulation loop or else the simulation will be too fast
* and keyboard / mouse input will be slow. For example: 
* <pre>
*	public void simulate() {
*	for (int rounds = 0; rounds < numRounds; rounds++) {
*           giveEachCreatureOneTurn();
*           WorldMap.pause(100);
*         }
*	}
* </pre>
